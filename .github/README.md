# üìíüìà Book of Profits

`book-of-profits` is a multichain portfolio tracker in
[REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) form.

It is private - All data is locally encrypted.

It features minimal and privacy preserving data fetching.\
External requests made by `book-of-profits` can be separated into two
categories:

- RPC calls: Used to query the blockchain
- Dexscreener API calls: Used to get the current price of tokens

If you're not content with the performance or privacy of the default RPC, you
can change it to one of your liking.

> [!NOTE]
> It is highly recommended to use custom RPCs, since the public ones often have
> severe rate limits.
